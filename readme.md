#  Classification Pipeline with Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to build a complete machine learning pipeline using **scikit-learn**, with preprocessing and modeling stages designed for tabular data.

The goal is to showcase proper usage of `Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`, and good preprocessing practices â€” in a clean and reusable format.

##  What's Inside

- Automatic separation of **numerical** and **categorical** features
- Missing value imputation:
  - Mean for numerical features
  - Most frequent value for categorical features
- Standardization of numerical features using `StandardScaler`
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Classification using `RandomForestClassifier`
